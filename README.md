# Smart Weather Station â€“ Final Project

This repository contains the individual submission for the Embedded Linux final project. The goal of this project is to build a lowâ€‘power smart weather station using a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, custom software, and a tailored Buildroot Linux system.

## Project Overview

Our station reads data from a BME280 sensor (temperature, humidity, pressure) and publishes the measurements to a cloud dashboard over Wiâ€‘Fi. The device uses a Buildrootâ€‘based Linux image customized for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and includes Python scripts for sensor interfacing, an MQTT client for data transmission, and optional local web configuration through a Flask API.

The detailed project plan â€” including goals, system architecture, hardware specifications, openâ€‘source components, sprint schedule, and team roles â€” is documented in our shared Project Overview wiki page: [ðŸ‘‰ Project Overview](https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/final-project-VasuPadsumbia/wiki)

Please refer to the wiki for design diagrams and the full schedule.

## Repository Structure

- `/buildroot/` â€” Buildroot configuration and board files (in group repository).
- `/app/` â€” Userâ€‘space application code (Python) for sensor reading, MQTT publishing, and web API.
- `/docs/` â€” Additional documentation or diagrams if needed.

(Individual repositories may contain a subset of the above, depending on personal contributions.)

## Getting Started

To build and run the project:

1. Clone the group repository and run `./build.sh`.
    This will set up the Buildroot environment and download the necessary dependencies.
2. Before the flash and build update the config_zero2w_64.txt from buildroot/board/raspberrypizero2w-64 with the following in order to connect with wifi and enable i2c properly
    ```
    # Enable Wi-Fi and IÂ²C
        device_tree=bcm2710-rpi-zero-2-w.dtb # use the correct device tree for Pi Zero 2 W
        dtparam=act_led_trigger=heartbeat # to enable heartbeat LED 
        dtparam=i2c_arm=on # to enable IÂ²C
        dtparam=spi=on # to enable SPI
    ```
3. If need any additional package got to buildroot directory and run `make menuconfig` to add any additional packages.
4. Run ./save_config.sh to save the configuration and then run ./build.sh to build the image.
5. This will download Buildroot, apply the necessary patches, and build the custom Linux image for the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W.
6. The output image will be located in `buildroot/output/images/`.
7. Flash the generated image onto a microSD card using a tool like `dd` or Balena Etcher.
8. Insert the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W and power it up.
9. The Python application should start automatically, reading sensor data and publishing it to the configured MQTT broker.
